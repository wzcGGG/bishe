## NOTES
##
## schedule.py returns the list of schedules in the following form:
## [S1,S2,S3,....S2000]
## Where Si is the schedule for student i
##
## Each schedule Si has the Following format:
## [A,B,W]
## That is, the schedule for day A, the schedule for Day B, and the schedule for the weekend
##
## Each of the A,B,W schedules is of length 24, of the following form:
## ['sleep',...,'sleep','dining',(0,1),(0,1),'dining','library','gym',.....]
##
## The possible options inside of the schedule:
## 'gym', 'library','social','dining','sleep','dorm'
